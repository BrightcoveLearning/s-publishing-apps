    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>In your Beacon apps' movies and episodic content you can set cue points that cause Beacon to display a button for the viewer to skip a video's introduction and/or credits.</p>

    <p>The following lists the behavior of the cue points and buttons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-roll and post-roll ads play regardless of cue point placement. Brightcove recommends NOT placing ads between skip button cue points, as this will not provide the best user experience.</li>
      <li>If the skip credits button is clicked, and there is an ad inserted before the end of the credits, all ads play.</li>
      <li>The skip button will appear on the trickplay while the video position is between the cue points. When the trickplay/controls are hidden, the skip buttons are displayed for 10 seconds before they disappear or at the end of the intro/credits stop cue point, whichever is sooner. You can change the 10-second default by contacting Brightcove's OTT Delivery Team.</li>
      <li>There is no validation of logical placement of cue points at this time.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>Once the cue points have been created, in the Beacon app when a movie or episode is playing a small <strong>Skip Intro</strong> or <strong>Skip Credits</strong> button is displayed at the desired times.</p>
