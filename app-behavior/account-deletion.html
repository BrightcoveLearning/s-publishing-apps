    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: the Beacon Apps implementation applies to all mobile/tablet and STV platforms with similar behavior.</aside>

    <p>When the viewer clicks the button, the beacon Apps performs the following tasks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirms the viewer wishes to delete the account.</li>
      <li>Alerts the viewer that they must cancel all active subscriptions with other platform's stores before Beacon account deletion can occur.</li>
      <li>Beacon backend verifies all of the viewer's active subscriptions with other platform's stores that there are no active subscriptions.</li>
      <li>Removal of viewer information from Stripe and other connected payment gateways, excluding native stores.</li>
      <li>Beacon user management service deletes the account and all associated data associated with that account, like preferences, favorites, recently watched, etc.</li>
      <li>Notifies the user the account is deleted, via a message in an app alert, when all conditions are met and deletion processes completed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that if a viewer uses an OIDC login, an additional message appears that you must contact your provider to do the deletions. Also, when you delete your account, an account with those credentials will be created. You can keep signing in, but all the information (bookmarks, favorites, recently watched) will be deleted. </p>
