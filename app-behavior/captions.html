    <h2 id="handling-empty-labels">Managing Multiple Tracks without Labels</h2>
    <p>In cases where multiple text tracks exist for the same language (e.g., en-US, en-GB) and none of them have labels, the following format is used for the text track title:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Language Variation:</strong> Include the language variation in the title (e.g., "English (United States)", "English (British)").</li>
        <li><strong>Text Track Type:</strong> Also, include the type of text track in the title (e.g., "Captions (en)", "Subtitle (en-GB)").
        </li>
    </ol>
