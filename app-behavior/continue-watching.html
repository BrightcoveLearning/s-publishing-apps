    <p>In your favorite OTT app, you can return and continue watching a series based on what episode you last completed, so you can continue enjoying the show in the expected order. This also applies to movies.
      In case you have partially watched more than one series, the continue watching row should show you the next episode in the series when you complete watching an episode.
